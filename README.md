Senior software engineer with 17+ years of experience developing software.

Examples of technologies that I've worked include REST APIs, text search using Apache Solr, message queues with RabbitMQ, cache with Redis, relational databases as Postgresql and Oracle and NoSql databases as MongoDB. I've also worked with high traffic, high availability and high scalability websites, especially using the Java language.

I'm very experienced with the frameworks Spring (Spring Boot, Spring Data and Spring MVC), Hibernate / JPA, the Maven building tool and Linux.

I also have experience working remotely. As a Senior Software Engineer I've worked in a full remote position for about three years.

Currently I'm also working with Python and AWS ( Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, RDS, Redis, Cloud Formation, Cloud Watch).
